<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these. In addition to mapping out a safe route for the pallet jack, the worker should make certain that the equipment will not be overloaded.

<p>Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack.
