Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA.

<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028.
