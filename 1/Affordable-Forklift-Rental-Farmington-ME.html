As someone with no forklift experience, you will do between three and six days of training before you take the test. Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>

The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
