They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>

The machine known as an orderpicker is an electric lift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
<p>Ideal for use in warehouses with vertical racking, Electric order pickers are available in either ride-on or walk-behind units. The type of tires you choose for your forklift greatly depends on the type of forklift you purchase and the driving environment.
