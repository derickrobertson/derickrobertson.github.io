<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance.

If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
