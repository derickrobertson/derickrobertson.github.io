RaymondÂ® Type E and EE trucks are designed and manufactured to operate in classified locations as defined in NFPA 505.</p>

It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
