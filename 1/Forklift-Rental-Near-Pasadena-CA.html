The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
<p>A rental forklift is often the best option when the need for the lift truck is mostly seasonal. In terms of lifting capacity, the pallet truck market can be divided into up to 2000kg, 2000kg to 5000kg, and above 5000kg. With individually configured new forklift trucks from Jungheinrich, you can breathe new life into your goods and material flow - with the highest levels of efficiency, power, safety and sustainability that can be found in a forklift.</p>

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
