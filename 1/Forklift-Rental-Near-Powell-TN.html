No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late.

In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period.

<p>Those same bumps and bounces that give off-road riding much of its thrill also wear out your rig's systems, especially the suspension. Maximal's New "A" Series Forklift is designed for the driver.
