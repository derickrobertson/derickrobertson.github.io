A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself.

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.
