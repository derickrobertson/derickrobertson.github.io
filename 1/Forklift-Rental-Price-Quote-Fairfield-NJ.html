<h2>Reach Lift Truck Fairfield</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes. Most kits include a standard or heavy duty compressor, a controller and all the hardware that you need to install the compressor onto your vehicle. This means that they are perfect for transporting heavy loads across rugged terrain, with some models handling up to 3 tonnes per load.</p>
