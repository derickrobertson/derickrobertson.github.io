Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts.

Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>We know all our customers' needs are different, which is why we offer Hyster and Yale forklift rentals on a flexible basis. Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>Welfaux also provide warehouse racking and pallet racking solutions, including service and associated equipment. Clearing Obstacles: With a lifted truck you'll be able to get over rocks or logs with ease.
