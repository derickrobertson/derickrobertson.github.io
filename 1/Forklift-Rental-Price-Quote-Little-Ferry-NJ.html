Many lifted truck owners purchased standard vehicles and later make modifications to them, either by themselves or with the help of a mechanic.</p>

<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. The boom can reach out directly in front of the forklift, and it can be extended to raise directly above it. Variable reach rough terrain forklifts were originally built for residential and commercial masonry trades. If you need to service, buy or rent a lift truck, make Altorfer Lift Truck your first call.</p>
