We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment.

<h2>Electric Lift Truck Wilmington</h2>
<p>I'd also like to say that I drive a truck, 2010 F-150 Platinum everyday to and from work and love trucks very dearly as I grew up driving them in Iowa. This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>
<p>Xtreme's new range made it into Construction Equipment magazine's top 100 products awards for 2018.

<p>It comprises all types of electric pallet trucks, forklift trucks, order pickers, reach trucks, tow tractors, tow train trailers and shuttle vehicles. An electric pallet jack is a pallet jack powered by batteries contained inside the pallet jack. All pedestrian operated trucks have forks that slide beneath the pallet and use a hydraulic jack to lift the load from the ground for easy manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
