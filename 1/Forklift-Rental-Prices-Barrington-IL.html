<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. You need to check out Kutztown Auto's inventory of New & Pre-Owned Lifted Truck Inventory near Reading, PA.

<p>Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform in a position that the center line of the truck is per-perpendicular the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. The wheels on most lifted trucks are quite a bit larger than those on standard-sized trucks.

<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift. The Multi-Task Control Handle allows operators to manage travel direction and speed while maneuvering during lift and reach operations.</p>
