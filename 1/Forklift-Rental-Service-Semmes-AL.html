<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market.

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
