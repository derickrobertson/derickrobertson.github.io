The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
