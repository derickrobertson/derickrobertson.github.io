<h2>Lift Truck Safety Jackson</h2>
<p>Knowing an accurate weight of the material being handled is crucial to the safe operation of your lift truck. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.

<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out.
