<p>The configurable Raymond 4750 4-Wheel Sit-Down Counterbalanced Forklift, well-known for its operator-friendly, open-mast” visibility, industry-leading ergonomics, and superior maintainability offers new features focused on better productivity, lower long-time costs, and enhanced driver comfort.

But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
<p>Forklift on hire you can find on heavy equipments. Other forklifts raise the operator with the forks, or are operated from a standing position. Ahern Rentals has over 40,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles available for rent across the US. A work platform of at least 20 inches wide must be securely attached to the lifting carriage or forks. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
