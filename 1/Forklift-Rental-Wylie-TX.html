<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck. Even for shorter distances you need the performance of the transport truck, because the pallet trucks have to master many difficult situations in a short time: Narrow aisles, tight truck loading bays or steep ramps make goods receiving and transport difficult.</p>
<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>Instead, pump trucks rely on good old-fashioned manual labor as the operator pumps” the jack to lift the skids with their own force.
