<h2>Electric Pallet Jacks Lakewood </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Second, you need to make sure you request a rental unit which has the specifications best suited to the loads you are trying to move. If you're searching for forklift companies in Victoria and Melbourne that offer exceptional quality customer service as well as unparalleled machinery, Damoli is for you.

<h2>Electric Pallet Truck Lakewood</h2>
<p>Body lift kits work to lift the body of the vehicle but continues to keep the chassis and suspension at the same height in relation to the ground. This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility. At the end of the day, lifting your truck can help you improve its look and performance, but you need to be confident in the work being done and the folks who are doing it. Even if that's not you, be honest.</p>
<p>Used both inside or outside in virtually any type of application, these forklifts have a large capacity range. We are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Hand Pallet Truck With Scale, which is an efficient product of our company. These kits will allow you to convert your existing air suspension to a coil system that provides a nearly identical ride.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
