<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>We comprehend the fact that majority of import firms in are active in sourcing distinct ranges of products including raw materials, machinery and consumer goods etc. We employ highly trained, certified technicians at all of our 94 locations to service and maintain all of our rental equipment to the highest standards, either in our own workshops or on the job-site.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>
