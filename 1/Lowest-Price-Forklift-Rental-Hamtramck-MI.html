<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty.

It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>

Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out. Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>
