<p>From maintenance vehicles and scissor lifts to electric burden carriers, personnel carriers, utility and specialty vehicles, and other warehouse equipment , we have a wide selection of solutions available with short- or long-term rental agreements to meet your changing business needs while minimizing the impact on your budget. Construction, heavy industry and mining continue to take advantage of rough- and all-terrain forklifts, while construction and agriculture have discovered the versatility of telehandlers.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
