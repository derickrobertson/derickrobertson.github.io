The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>

<h3>Forklift Truck Counterbalance Murphysboro IL</h3>

Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. TPC Training's online and safety video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
