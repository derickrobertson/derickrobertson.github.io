<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc. With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>Forklifts and lift trucks are an essential part of most construction projects and carry their own set of hazards depending on the vehicle type and the workplace where the truck is used. Toyota Material Handling Term Rental System delivers operating costs on an annual basis, simplifying budgeting and cost control.

<p>The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine. We specialise in NZ forklifts including electric forklifts, VNA forklifts and used forklifts for sale. Experienced lift truck owners and operators may find this guide to the various forklift types to be a useful refresher.
