<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics.

Identify the maximum load weight you need to lift, and rent a forklift that could support such capacity. The Black Widow is a professionally lifted truck by SCA Performance.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
