Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>It is best to replace them in pairs to maintain an even ride height from side-to-side. Standing forklifts are also typically easier to move around and maneuver around corners and in tight spaces. As the go-to forklift dealership in the region, we're always here to provide the support you need. An initial study is conducted to identify the Pallet Trucks market structure and demand pattern of the Pallet Trucks by the segments (i.e. by Control, by Type, by Load Capacity and by End Use in each prominent region of the globe.</p>
