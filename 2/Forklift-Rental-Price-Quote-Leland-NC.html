<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

Truck drivers from the Richardson and Garland regions won't believe the lifted trucks and 4x4 conversion trucks on sale right now at Young Chevrolet in Dallas. Forklift trucks need to spend the maximum amount of time hard at work.</p>
