We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits.

<p>Firstly, a different training course is required for each type of forklift you wish to operate. Rough terrain pallet jacks 5 are designed specifically for use on uneven ground.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
