<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV.

With our electric reach trucks, you will enjoy a number of technical and ergonomic benefits. The following are examples of Class V powered industrial trucks.

<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>
<h2>Lift Truck Manufacturers Mission</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
