<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<h2>Forklifts & Material Handling Equipment Saint Helena Island </h2>
<p>Toyota provides complete safety training for forklifts. OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.
