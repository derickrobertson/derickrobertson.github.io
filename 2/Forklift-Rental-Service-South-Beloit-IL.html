Piggyback lifts - They are designed to lock on the back of delivery trucks for easy transportation to work sites as well as the smooth offloading of products.

To make sure that this is met even in confined spaces, Linde designed the reach trucks for optimum visibility and fitted them with appropriate equipment.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.
