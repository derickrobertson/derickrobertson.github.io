Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>
