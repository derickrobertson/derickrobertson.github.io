Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments. Our exclusive lifted models make these professional-grade trucks even more impressive and capable.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas.

Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

Longitudinal stability isn't the only concern for lift truck operators. This is a lifting aid that you can adjust to your requirements, ensuring an efficient workflow, safe for both operators and goods.</p>

When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>For example, if what you are used to is an automatic car, test driving should not be the time for you to attempt driving a stick shift vehicle. The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems.
