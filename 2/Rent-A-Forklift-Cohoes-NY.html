<p>But with lift kits, the danger is a little different. Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. Airide air bag suspension springs are manufactured by Firestone for heavy truck, trailer and bus for applications such as steering axle, seat, cab mount, drive axle, lift axle, and primary trailer air suspension.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
